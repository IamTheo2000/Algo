Written and programming excercises for the algorithms course - NTUA


This repository contains my solutions for the assignments of the algorithms course in NTUA for the winter semeseter 2022-2023. The course material for the specific academic year included among others the following:

* Asymptotic estimation of computational complexity.
* Asymptotic Notation
* Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms
* Closest pair of points.
* Curved cover
* Quicksort
* Deterministic selection in linear time.
* Sorting in linear time.
* Linear search, binary search, interpolation search and applications
* Greedy algorithms.
* Dynamic Programming.
* String Matching.
* Shorter Paths
* Maximum flow and minimum cut
* Minimum cost flow
* Probabilistic algorithms
* Turing machines and computability
* Computational complexity
* Reductions
* Non-determinism
* NP-completeness
* Probabilistic algorithms
* Approximation algorithms

Each written assignment contain two files, the assignment int greek and my implementation. The programming excercises contain the assignment itself, the two .cpp files containing my implementation and the input/ouptut files. There is also a test.py script to check if the implementation passes the test cases given as input/output.
